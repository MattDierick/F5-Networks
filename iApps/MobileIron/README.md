## iAPP for MobileIron on APM

2.2.1 - Updated to support ios11

### WARNING


It seems MobileIron stopped APIv1. So this iApp will not work anymore because APIv1 is used to retrieve device informations and compliancy. APIv2 was used to retrieve device in DB from its UDID.

iApp has to be recoded in order to use APIv2 for complicancy check and enrollment check
