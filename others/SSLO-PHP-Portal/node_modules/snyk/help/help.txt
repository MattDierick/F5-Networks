run the command against the current working directory allowing you
test you non-public applications.

Commands:

  auth [api-token] ... sign into snyk.
  test ............... test for any known vulnerabilities.
  wizard ............. configure your policy file to update, auto patch and
                       ignore vulnerabilities.
  protect ............ protect your code from vulnerabilities and
                       optionally suppress specific vulnerabilities.
  monitor ............ record the state of dependencies and any
                       vulnerabilities on snyk.io.
  policy ............. display the Snyk policy for a package.

Options:

  --dev .............. include devDependencies (defaults to production only).
  --org=<org-name> ... associate a snapshot (or wizard snapshot) with a specific

  --ignore-policy .... ignores and resets the state of your policy file.
  --trust-policies ... applies and uses ignore rules from your dependencies's
                       Snyk policies, otherwise ignore policies are only
                       shown as a suggestion.
  --dry-run .......... don't apply updates or patches during protect.
  -q, --quiet ........ silence all output.
  -h, --help ......... this help information.

  $ snyk test

Pro tip: use `snyk test` in your test scripts, if a vulnerability is
found, the process will exit with a non-zero exit code.
