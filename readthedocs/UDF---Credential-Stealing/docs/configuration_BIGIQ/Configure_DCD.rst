Configure the DCD
=================

Configuring the BIGIQ DCD is pretty simple. This machine only receives alerts from the BIGIP. Then, the BIGIQ CM will render the alerts.

.. note:: BIGIQ DCD is an elastic search.

The steps are :

  1. License the BIGIQ DCD with a Logging Node license
  2. Set a Self IP address and a VLAN (on the production side, management is already set)

.. note:: Nothing else to do on BIGIQ DCD side
